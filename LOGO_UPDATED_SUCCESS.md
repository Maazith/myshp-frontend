# ✅ Logo Successfully Updated!

## What Was Fixed

I noticed you saved the logo as `logo.jpg` but all the code was looking for `logo.png`. I've updated all references to use `logo.jpg`:

### Files Updated:
- ✅ `frontend/assets/css/style.css` - Background watermark now uses logo.jpg
- ✅ `frontend/assets/js/components.js` - Navbar logo now uses logo.jpg
- ✅ `frontend/pages/login.html` - Login page logo now uses logo.jpg
- ✅ `frontend/assets/js/admin.js` - Admin sidebar logo now uses logo.jpg

## 🎨 Logo Will Now Appear:

1. **Navbar** (top left corner)
   - White logo next to "EdithCloths" text

2. **Background Watermark** (centered, subtle)
   - 15% opacity, 600px width
   - Fixed position, doesn't scroll

3. **Login Page** (prominent display)
   - 250px width, centered above form

4. **Admin Pages** (sidebar)
   - Logo in admin navigation

## 🔄 Next Step:

**Refresh your browser** with hard refresh:
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

---

**Your Edith logo should now appear everywhere!** 🎨✨
