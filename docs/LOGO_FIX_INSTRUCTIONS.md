# 🔧 Fix Logo Issue - Quick Steps

## ⚠️ Problem
Your `logo.png` file is currently an HTML file, not an image. That's why it's not showing up.

## ✅ Solution - Save the Image Properly

### Step 1: Delete the Bad File
1. Go to: `frontend/assets/images/logo.png`
2. Delete this file (it's HTML, not an image)

### Step 2: Save the Correct Image
1. **Right-click** on the Edith logo image you showed me
2. Select **"Save image as..."** (NOT "Save page as")
3. Choose file type: **PNG** or **JPEG**
4. Save as: `logo.png`
5. Save to: `frontend/assets/images/logo.png`

### Step 3: Verify
- File should open in an image viewer
- File size should be reasonable (a few KB to a few MB)
- NOT an HTML file

### Step 4: Refresh
- Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Logo will appear in navbar and background!

## 📍 Logo Will Appear In:
- ✅ Navbar (top left, white)
- ✅ Background (centered, 12% opacity watermark)
- ✅ Login page (prominent display)

**Once you save the actual image file (not HTML), everything will work!** 🎨
