# 🎨 Edith Logo Setup Guide

## Step 1: Save Your Logo Image

1. **Save the Edith logo** you showed me as: `frontend/assets/images/logo.png`

   The logo should contain:
   - Character with top hat and mustache
   - "EDITH" text
   - "EVEN DEAD I AM THE HERO" text

2. **Right-click on the logo image** → Save As → Name it `logo.png`
3. **Save it to:** `frontend/assets/images/logo.png`

## Step 2: Logo Usage

The logo will automatically be used as:
- ✅ **Navbar Logo** - Shows in header on all pages
- ✅ **Background Watermark** - Subtle logo in background (8% opacity)
- ✅ **Login Page** - Logo visible in navbar
- ✅ **All Pages** - Consistent logo throughout

## Step 3: Background Effect

The CSS is configured to:
- Show the logo as a **subtle watermark** in the center of the background
- Logo appears at **8% opacity** so it doesn't interfere with content
- Positioned in the center, fixed (doesn't scroll)

## Step 4: After Saving

Once you save `logo.png`:
1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. The logo will appear in:
   - Navbar (top left)
   - Background (subtle watermark)

**The logo setup is ready! Just save your logo.png image and refresh!** 🎨
