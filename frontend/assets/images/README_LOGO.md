# Logo Setup

## Save Your Logo Image

1. Save the Edith logo image as `logo.png` in this folder: `frontend/assets/images/logo.png`

The logo should show:
- Character with top hat and mustache
- "EDITH" text
- "EVEN DEAD I AM THE HERO" text

## Background Image

The logo will automatically be used as:
- Navbar logo
- Background watermark (subtle pattern)
- Login page background

All CSS is already configured to use `logo.png` from this folder.
