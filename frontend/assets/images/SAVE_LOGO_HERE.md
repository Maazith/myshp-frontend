# 📸 IMPORTANT: Save Your Logo Image Here

## Steps to Save the Edith Logo:

1. **Right-click** on the Edith logo image (character with top hat + "EDITH" + "EVEN DEAD I AM THE HERO")

2. **Select "Save image as..."** (NOT "Save page as")

3. **Save as:** `logo.png`

4. **Save location:** This folder (`frontend/assets/images/`)

5. **Verify:**
   - File should be a PNG or JPG image
   - Should open in an image viewer
   - File size: typically a few KB to a few MB

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes:
- ❌ DON'T save as HTML
- ❌ DON'T save the webpage
- ✅ DO save the actual image file

## ✅ After Saving:
- The logo will automatically appear in:
  - Navbar (top left)
  - Background watermark (centered, subtle)
  - Login page (prominent)
