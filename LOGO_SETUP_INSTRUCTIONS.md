# Logo & Background Setup Instructions

## 📸 Step 1: Save the Edith Logo Image

1. Right-click on the Edith logo image you showed me
2. Save it as `logo.png` in `frontend/assets/images/logo.png`
3. Also save it as `background.png` in `frontend/assets/images/background.png` (for background use)

**File locations:**
- Logo: `frontend/assets/images/logo.png`
- Background: `frontend/assets/images/background.png`

## ✅ Step 2: CSS Already Updated

The CSS has been updated to:
- Use the logo image as background pattern
- Reference logo.png for the navbar logo

## 🎨 Background Options

The background can be set to:
1. **Full background image** - Large version of the logo as wallpaper
2. **Subtle pattern** - Repeating pattern of the logo
3. **Watermark effect** - Faded logo in the background

I've set it up for a subtle pattern. The CSS is ready!
