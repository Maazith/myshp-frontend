# ✅ Navbar Logo Fixed!

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

The navbar had an empty white box because the navbar component wasn't being initialized on the login page.

### Changes Made:

1. **Added Navbar Initialization** to `frontend/pages/login.html`:
   - Added script to import and mount the navbar component
   - Added footer mounting as well

2. **Improved Logo CSS**:
   - Added better error handling for missing logo images
   - Ensured logo displays properly in navbar

## 🎨 Logo Display Locations:

1. **Navbar** (top left) ✅
   - Logo + "EdithCloths" text
   - Now properly mounted and displayed

2. **Background Watermark** ✅
   - Centered, 15% opacity
   - Subtle watermark effect

3. **Login Page** ✅
   - Large logo above form
   - "EDITHCLOTHS" heading

## 🔄 Next Step:

**Refresh your browser** (Ctrl + Shift + R) and the navbar logo should now appear correctly!

**The empty white box should now be replaced with your Edith logo!** 🎨
